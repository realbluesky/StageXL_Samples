        <p>StageXL is a package for the Dart programming language. It offers 
        an easy to use and complete API for impressive 2D content like games 
        and other rich applications. The library started as an easy migration 
        path for Adobe Flash developers to HTML5. Therefore the StageXL API 
        is for the most part identical to the Flash API. Today many developers 
        who have no prior experience with Flash are using StageXL for their 
        applications.</p>

            HTML5 with the help of Dart and StageXL. The whole process only took
            a few hours because no substantial code changes were necessary. 
            The game uses bitmaps, sprites, sounds, text fields, event 
            listeners, etc.</td>

            ported to HTML5. Just as with the game 'Escape' the source code
            was ported from ActionScript to Dart without much fuss. This 
            game uses vector graphics, bitmaps, sounds, masks, etc. </td>

            All display objects are drawn as vector graphics and cached as 
            bitmaps for optimal performance. The animations are done with the 
            Juggler animation framework which is fully integrated in StageXL.
            The stage is automatically scaled to fill the whole browser 
            window.</td>

            The demo shows the audio playback capabilities of StageXL in 
            different browsers. Playing HTML5 audio can be tricky, but StageXL 
            offers an easy to use cross browser Sound API (compatible to 
            the Flash API).</td>

            about drawing small images and doing animations. As with all
            benchmarks, it's important to look at the use case and think
